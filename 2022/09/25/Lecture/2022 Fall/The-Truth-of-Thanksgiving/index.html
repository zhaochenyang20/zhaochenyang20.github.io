<ol type="1">
<li>Is it necessary to the American psyche to perpetually exploit and debase its victims in order to justify its history?</li>
<li>In history, truth should be held sacred, at whatever cost ... especially against the narrow and futile patriotism, which, instead of pressing forward in pursuit of truth, takes pride in walking backwards to cover the slightest nakedness of our forefathers.</li>
<li>After all, neither Indians nor Pilgrims had access to the germ theory of disease. Indian healers could supply no cure; their medicines and herbs offered no relief. Their religion provided no explanation. That of the whites did. Like the Europeans three centuries before them, many Indians surrendered to alcohol, converted to Christianity, or simply killed themselves.</li>
<li>But pre-Pilgrim American epidemiology is not a field of everyday knowledge in which "common sense" can be allowed to substitute for years of relevant research. By "common sense" what McEvedy really meant was tradition.</li>
<li>What has happened cannot be changed, but today we work toward a better America, a more Indian America where people and nature once again are important.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="argument">Argument</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Starting the story of America's settlement with the Pilgrims leaves out not only the Indians but also the Spanish.</li>
<li>Beginning the story in 1620 also omits the Dutch, who were living in what is now Albany by 1614.</li>
<li>The warmer parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa have historically been the breeding ground for most of mankind's illnesses.</li>
<li>enjoyed before or since. Many of the diseases that had long shadowed them simply could not survive the journey.</li>
<li>Europe and Asia were also made unhealthy by a subtler factor: social density.</li>
<li>Some areas in the Americas did have high social density.</li>
<li>The scarcity of disease in the Americas was also partly attributable to the basic hygiene practiced by the region's inhabitants.</li>
<li>Ironically, their very health proved their undoing, for they had built up no resistance, genetically or through childhood diseases, to the microbes that Europeans and Africans would bring to them.</li>
<li>Many Indians likewise inferred that their god had abandoned them.</li>
<li>Today, as we compare European technology with that of the "primitive" Indians, we may conclude that European conquest of America was inevitable, but it did not appear so at the time.</li>
<li>If colonists had not been able to occupy lands already cleared by Indian farmers who had vanished, colonization would have proceeded much more slowly. If Indian culture had not been devastated by the physical and psychological assaults it had suffered, colonization might not have proceeded at all.</li>
<li>Europeans were never able to "settle" China, India, Indonesia, Japan, or much of Africa, because too many people already lived there.</li>
<li>The Europeans' advantages in military and social technology might have enabled them to dominate the Americas, as they eventually dominated China, India, Indonesia, and Africa, but not to "settle" the hemisphere. For that, the plague was required. Thus, apart from the European (and African) invasion itself, the pestilence is surely the most important event in the history of America.</li>
<li>But there is no record of any continental [European] population being cut back by the sort of percentages needed to get from twenty million to two or one million. Even the Black Death reduced the population of Europe by only a third.</li>
<li>Scholars who viewed Native American cultures as primitive reduced their estimates of precontact populations to match the stereotype.</li>
<li>The problem is not so much the estimates as the attitude.</li>
<li>About the plagues the textbooks tell even less.</li>
<li>In colonial times, everyone knew about the plague.</li>
<li>Certainly the Pilgrims already knew quite a bit about what Massachusetts could offer them,</li>
<li>These considerations prompt me to believe that the Pilgrim leaders probably ended up in Massachusetts on purpose.</li>
<li>Each textbook picks just one reason and presents it as fact.</li>
<li>The whole story places the Pilgrims in a somewhat dishonorable light, however, which may explain why only one textbook selects it.</li>
<li>So far as any record shows, this was the first time in human history that a group of people consciously created a government where none had existed before.</li>
<li>"This rare opportunity for a great social and political experiment may never come again." The American Way declares, "The American people have created a unique nation." How is America exceptional?</li>
<li>And the goodness started at Plymouth Rock, according to our textbooks, which view the Pilgrims as Christian, sober, democratic, generous to the Indians, God-thanking. Such a happy portrait can be painted only by omitting the facts about the plague, the possible hijacking, and the Indian relations.</li>
<li>The chief Design of all Parties concerned was to fetch away the Treasure from thence, aiming more at sudden Gain, than to form any regular Colony.</li>
<li>looking for gold instead of planting crops. Soon they were starving and digging up putrid Indian corpses to eat or renting themselves out to Indian families as servants-hardly the heroic founders that a great nation requires.</li>
<li>Textbooks indeed cover the Virginia colony, and they at least mention the Spanish settlements, but they devote 50 percent more space to Massachusetts. As a result, and due also to Thanksgiving, of course, students are much more likely to remember the Pilgrims as our founders.</li>
<li>But neither our culture nor our textbooks give Virginia the same archetypal status as Massachusetts. That is why almost all my students.</li>
<li>Throughout New England, colonists appropriated Indian cornfields for their initial settlements, avoiding the backbreaking labor of clearing the land of forest and rock.</li>
<li>Moreover, not all the Native inhabitants had perished, and the survivors now facilitated British settlement.</li>
<li>From the start, the Pilgrims thanked God, not the Indians, for assistance that the latter had (inadvertently) provided-setting a pattern for later thanksgivings.</li>
<li>"Their profit" was the primary reason most Mayflower colonists made the trip. As Robert Moore has pointed out, "Textbooks neglect to analyze the profit motive underlying much of our history.”</li>
<li>We have seen, for example, how King James and the early Pilgrim leaders gave thanks for the plague, which proved to them that God was on their side.</li>
<li>God on our side, civilization wrested from the wilderness, order from disorder, through hard work and good Pilgrim character traits-continue to radiate from our history textbooks.</li>
<li>"For these unexcelled blessings, the pupil is urged to follow in the footsteps of his forbears, to offer unquestioning obedience to the law of the land, and to carry on the work begun.”</li>
<li>In this invocation, the Pilgrims supply not only the origin of the United States, but also the inspiration for democracy in Europe and perhaps for all goodness in the world today! I suspect that the original colonists, Separatists and Anglicans alike, would have been amused.</li>
<li>Today Americans believe as part of our political understanding of the world that we are the most generous nation on earth in terms of foreign aid, overlooking the fact that the net dollar flow from almost every Third World nation runs toward the United States.</li>
<li>The true history of Thanksgiving reveals embarrassing facts. The Pilgrims did not introduce the tradition.</li>
<li>The ideological meaning American history has ascribed to Thanksgiving compounds the embarrassment. The Thanksgiving legend makes Americans ethnocentric. After all, if our culture has God on its side, why should we consider other cultures seriously?</li>
<li>Today, when textbooks promote this ethnocentrism with their Pilgrim stories, they leave students less able to learn from and deal with people from other cultures.</li>
<li>In sum, U.S. history is no more violent and oppressive than the history of England, Russia, Indonesia, or Burundi-but neither is it exceptionally less violent.</li>
<li>The antidote to feel-good history is not feel-bad history but honest and inclusive history. If textbook authors feel compelled to give moral instruction, the way origin myths have always done, they could accomplish this aim by allowing students to learn both the "good" and the "bad" sides of the Pilgrim tale. Conflict would then become part of the story, and students might discover that the knowledge they gain has implications for their lives today. Correctly taught, the issues of the era of the first Thanksgiving could help Americans grow more thoughtful and more tolerant, rather than more ethnocentric.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="report">Report</h1>
<p>Before reading this paragraph, I learned a lot about the history of North American Indians. So when I saw the title, I did not have too high expectations in my heart. In addition, before reading this article, I also watched a TED Talk shared by the teacher. That TED Talk mainly tells the history of the Lakota ethnic group being deceived, oppressed, and slaughtered by the white race for hundreds of years, which has deeply aroused people's empathy. I thought this document would be like the TED Talk, telling some of the contradictions between Indians and White and then detailing the cruelty, hypocrisy, and cunning of White to awaken national consciousness.</p>
<p>However, reading through the whole text, I can't help but admire the author's original intention in writing. We can summarize his original intention in the following three sentences.</p>
<div class="note success modern"><p>In history, truth should be held sacred at whatever cost.</p>
<p>U.S. history is no more violent and oppressive than the history of England, Russia, Indonesia, or Burundi-but neither is it exceptionally less violent.</p>
<p>What has happened cannot be changed, but today we work toward a better America, a more Indian America where people and nature once again are essential.</p>
</div>
<p>Through many details, the author explains why white immigrants settled in the Americas, not colonized them. Then discuss the impact of the plague on the Indians far beyond imagination. It has since been explained that even for the Puritans aboard the Mayflower, their arrival in the New World was hypocritical and by no means as noble as the American history books record. It explains why Americans, and even major Western countries, do their best to cover up this history of violence and conflict to make their national claims look very noble. Written here, the author has achieved the meaning of disenchanting American history, but the author finally discusses his claim.</p>
<p>He wrote that much dirt is behind the seemingly glorious history of the United States. However, discussing these issues is not to criticize the United States but to enable Americans, especially American children, to recognize and face up to the history of their own country. America's history is full of violence and conflict, but this is a common human problem, not an American problem. The United States will not be more conflicted than Russia, China, and India, but it will never be less. Everything he writes is about making a better America.</p>
<p>Next, I would like to discuss two aspects in detail. ## It is irresponsible to question the impact of the disease.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that because the Black Death only killed one-third of the people in Eurasia, they questioned that milder diseases such as smallpox and malaria would not kill more than 90% of the Indians. The author criticizes this and believes that these so-called scholars are just unwilling to admit the hypocrisy of the history written in textbooks, want to maintain the sanctity of American history, and insist on the tone of the past.</p>
<p>But pre-Pilgrim American epidemiology is not a field of everyday knowledge in which "common sense" can be allowed to substitute for years of relevant research. By "common sense," what these scholars meant was tradition. The author spends considerable time in the original text discussing why the disease has a tremendous impact. Many diseases sound very mild in Eurasia. Why did the Indians die in large numbers? I was also surprised by this, and I was skeptical at first. Also, I've read something similar in Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, and I still find it a little unbelievable. However, after reading the author's exposition or studying the historical materials written by the author, my doubts have been resolved.</p>
<p>Deviating from some so-called common sense and thinking through learning has always benefited me a lot. However, many people do not want to do so. Because for humans, thinking based on logic is pain or a burden. The goal of learning and logical thinking is to seek a new body of knowledge, which must first overthrow the inherent mode of thinking. For example, after learning Newton's laws, you deny the common sense that large and small iron balls fall at different speeds, and you must abandon the intuition that force is the cause of object motion. This process is very uncomfortable and can even cause a sense of strangeness and fear in the world because of reacquainting with the environment.</p>
<p>Therefore, human instinct is to protect the spiritual comfort zone and refuse to give up existing knowledge systems. If it is not for the great benefit or fear of threats, human beings would instead tie up and burn those who force themselves to think and accept the simple and crude answers provided by religion. In the 10,000-year history of civilized society, most human beings usually allowed a particular religion to exercise spiritual control over themselves. The main reason is to obtain an answer and gain a sense of psychological security.</p>
<p>However, in the past few hundred years, the tremendous geographical discovery and the industrial revolution have brought unprecedented development space for humankind, and the situation has begun to change. Some people find that they can lead a more prosperous and accessible life through logical and rational thinking. Some people even find that if they do not learn to think logically and solve problems with reason, the spiritual security provided by religion and feudalism cannot be maintained. Therefore, the modern education system has expanded worldwide along with the industrial society, forming the modern society we are familiar with.</p>
<p>Above is my understanding of the necessity of learning and thinking logically. The same goes for this article. Only when we give up the so-called common sense about diseases and learn relevant historical materials can we realize the massive impact of conditions on Indians and then face up to the history of whites and Indians. Emotions cannot resolve conflicts, and conflicts are not ethnic conflicts.</p>
<p>Throughout the article, the author does not have much emotional narrative, which is different from the TED Talk I mentioned at the beginning. And I agree more with the author's approach. Emotions cannot solve contradictions. Only by facing history squarely can we solve contradictions.</p>
<h2 id="emotions-cannot-resolve-conflicts-and-conflicts-are-not-ethnic-conflicts.">Emotions cannot resolve conflicts, and conflicts are not ethnic conflicts.</h2>
<p>However, the author has written so much that I do not see how he views the contradiction between the Indians and the white colonists. One of the big reasons I cannot entirely agree with the TED Talk is that TED Talk constantly exaggerates the conflicts between nationalities, believing that the root of the conflict is that two different nationalities have lived in a very long historical process with massive oppression and bleeding. There are many bloodsheds, and the current white people need to atone for the sins of their ancestors.</p>
<p>This view has some validity, but I cannot fully agree with it because the source of conflict is not a race. I believe in Marxism, and for me, there is only one kind of contradiction in the world: the contradiction between the vested interests and the proletariat.</p>
<p>Marx creatively put forward the theory of class struggle in the 19th century, arguing that all social history so far is the history of class struggle. The difference between the vested interests and the proletariat is whether or not the means of production are mastered. Those who master the means of production are the bourgeoisie, and those who do not master the means of production are the proletariat. Marxist theory is so simple that even an uneducated person can know which class he belongs to and who his enemy is.</p>
<p>To disrupt the impact of the proletariat on their rule, vested interests in the United States created the theory of identity politics.</p>
<p>The main feature of the so-called identity politics is the political movement based on identity. In detail, the American ruling class differentiates between groups with different external characteristics. For example, people are divided into black, gay, Asian, transgender, and so on. All the demands of the proletariat are anti-oppression. However, the ruling class does not speak of anti-oppression, only labels. For example, today, the ruling class designs policies to care for black people. Then other groups will be dissatisfied and start to hate black people. Then, the ruling class develops an approach to taking care of homosexuals. The homosexuals are satisfied, and other groups are dissatisfied. By analogy, these policies are similar, but the ruling class has to formulate them separately and distribute benefits according to various labels. Finally, the contradiction between the ruling class and the proletariat is transformed into a conflict between labels. This is the so-called identity politics.</p>
<p>In the Marxist view, the only enemy of the American proletariat is the ruling class itself. However, through identity politics, the proletariat has become enemies of each other because of their different identities, and the real enemy is hidden behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Only a party based on a precise class can formulate an effective movement program. For example, the working class will hope to form a Labour Party and establish a sound social welfare system. To ensure the quality of people's work and life, the bourgeoisie will want to develop a liberal party, reduce the market regulation, and facilitate them to squeeze the labor income of the proletariat. However, it is difficult for political parties established by external identities to have precise demands. Suppose a black party was set; what else could they do but demand better welfare for all blacks? When underclass blacks label themselves black Americans, their enemies change from vested interests to groups of other colors. Yet the vast majority of other groups are also proletarians. This will only lead to infighting the proletariat rather than genuinely resisting the oppression of those with vested interests.</p>
<p>Only when every proletarian American realizes that he is an American, not a so-called African-American or Asian-American and that his enemies are vested interests of the United States and not other fellow Americans can unite and make a nation better instead of putting your group at odds with other groups.</p>
