<h2 id="extraction">Extraction</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is it necessary to the American psyche to perpetually exploit and
debase its victims in order to justify its history?</li>
<li>In history, truth should be held sacred, at whatever cost ...
especially against the narrow and futile patriotism, which, instead of
pressing forward in pursuit of truth, takes pride in walking backwards
to cover the slightest nakedness of our forefathers.</li>
<li>After all, neither Indians nor Pilgrims had access to the germ
theory of disease. Indian healers could supply no cure; their medicines
and herbs offered no relief. Their religion provided no explanation.
That of the whites did. Like the Europeans three centuries before them,
many Indians surrendered to alcohol, converted to Christianity, or
simply killed themselves.</li>
<li>But pre-Pilgrim American epidemiology is not a field of everyday
knowledge in which "common sense" can be allowed to substitute for years
of relevant research. By "common sense" what McEvedy really meant was
tradition.</li>
<li>What has happened cannot be changed, but today we work toward a
better America, a more Indian America where people and nature once again
are important.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="argument">Argument</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Starting the story of America's settlement with the Pilgrims leaves
out not only the Indians but also the Spanish.</li>
<li>Beginning the story in 1620 also omits the Dutch, who were living in
what is now Albany by 1614.</li>
<li>The warmer parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa have historically been
the breeding ground for most of mankind's illnesses.</li>
<li>enjoyed before or since. Many of the diseases that had long shadowed
them simply could not survive the journey.</li>
<li>Europe and Asia were also made unhealthy by a subtler factor: social
density.</li>
<li>Some areas in the Americas did have high social density.</li>
<li>The scarcity of disease in the Americas was also partly attributable
to the basic hygiene practiced by the region's inhabitants.</li>
<li>Ironically, their very health proved their undoing, for they had
built up no resistance, genetically or through childhood diseases, to
the microbes that Europeans and Africans would bring to them.</li>
<li>Many Indians likewise inferred that their god had abandoned
them.</li>
<li>Today, as we compare European technology with that of the
"primitive" Indians, we may conclude that European conquest of America
was inevitable, but it did not appear so at the time.</li>
<li>If colonists had not been able to occupy lands already cleared by
Indian farmers who had vanished, colonization would have proceeded much
more slowly. If Indian culture had not been devastated by the physical
and psychological assaults it had suffered, colonization might not have
proceeded at all.</li>
<li>Europeans were never able to "settle" China, India, Indonesia,
Japan, or much of Africa, because too many people already lived
there.</li>
<li>The Europeans' advantages in military and social technology might
have enabled them to dominate the Americas, as they eventually dominated
China, India, Indonesia, and Africa, but not to "settle" the hemisphere.
For that, the plague was required. Thus, apart from the European (and
African) invasion itself, the pestilence is surely the most important
event in the history of America.</li>
<li>But there is no record of any continental [European] population
being cut back by the sort of percentages needed to get from twenty
million to two or one million. Even the Black Death reduced the
population of Europe by only a third.</li>
<li>Scholars who viewed Native American cultures as primitive reduced
their estimates of precontact populations to match the stereotype.</li>
<li>The problem is not so much the estimates as the attitude.</li>
<li>About the plagues the textbooks tell even less.</li>
<li>In colonial times, everyone knew about the plague.</li>
<li>Certainly the Pilgrims already knew quite a bit about what
Massachusetts could offer them,</li>
<li>These considerations prompt me to believe that the Pilgrim leaders
probably ended up in Massachusetts on purpose.</li>
<li>Each textbook picks just one reason and presents it as fact.</li>
<li>The whole story places the Pilgrims in a somewhat dishonorable
light, however, which may explain why only one textbook selects it.</li>
<li>So far as any record shows, this was the first time in human history
that a group of people consciously created a government where none had
existed before.</li>
<li>"This rare opportunity for a great social and political experiment
may never come again." The American Way declares, "The American people
have created a unique nation." How is America exceptional?</li>
<li>And the goodness started at Plymouth Rock, according to our
textbooks, which view the Pilgrims as Christian, sober, democratic,
generous to the Indians, God-thanking. Such a happy portrait can be
painted only by omitting the facts about the plague, the possible
hijacking, and the Indian relations.</li>
<li>The chief Design of all Parties concerned was to fetch away the
Treasure from thence, aiming more at sudden Gain, than to form any
regular Colony.</li>
<li>looking for gold instead of planting crops. Soon they were starving
and digging up putrid Indian corpses to eat or renting themselves out to
Indian families as servants-hardly the heroic founders that a great
nation requires.</li>
<li>Textbooks indeed cover the Virginia colony, and they at least
mention the Spanish settlements, but they devote 50 percent more space
to Massachusetts. As a result, and due also to Thanksgiving, of course,
students are much more likely to remember the Pilgrims as our
founders.</li>
<li>But neither our culture nor our textbooks give Virginia the same
archetypal status as Massachusetts. That is why almost all my
students.</li>
<li>Throughout New England, colonists appropriated Indian cornfields for
their initial settlements, avoiding the backbreaking labor of clearing
the land of forest and rock.</li>
<li>Moreover, not all the Native inhabitants had perished, and the
survivors now facilitated British settlement.</li>
<li>From the start, the Pilgrims thanked God, not the Indians, for
assistance that the latter had (inadvertently) provided-setting a
pattern for later thanksgivings.</li>
<li>"Their profit" was the primary reason most Mayflower colonists made
the trip. As Robert Moore has pointed out, "Textbooks neglect to analyze
the profit motive underlying much of our history.”</li>
<li>We have seen, for example, how King James and the early Pilgrim
leaders gave thanks for the plague, which proved to them that God was on
their side.</li>
<li>God on our side, civilization wrested from the wilderness, order
from disorder, through hard work and good Pilgrim character
traits-continue to radiate from our history textbooks.</li>
<li>"For these unexcelled blessings, the pupil is urged to follow in the
footsteps of his forbears, to offer unquestioning obedience to the law
of the land, and to carry on the work begun.”</li>
<li>In this invocation, the Pilgrims supply not only the origin of the
United States, but also the inspiration for democracy in Europe and
perhaps for all goodness in the world today! I suspect that the original
colonists, Separatists and Anglicans alike, would have been amused.</li>
<li>Today Americans believe as part of our political understanding of
the world that we are the most generous nation on earth in terms of
foreign aid, overlooking the fact that the net dollar flow from almost
every Third World nation runs toward the United States.</li>
<li>The true history of Thanksgiving reveals embarrassing facts. The
Pilgrims did not introduce the tradition.</li>
<li>The ideological meaning American history has ascribed to
Thanksgiving compounds the embarrassment. The Thanksgiving legend makes
Americans ethnocentric. After all, if our culture has God on its side,
why should we consider other cultures seriously?</li>
<li>Today, when textbooks promote this ethnocentrism with their Pilgrim
stories, they leave students less able to learn from and deal with
people from other cultures.</li>
<li>In sum, U.S. history is no more violent and oppressive than the
history of England, Russia, Indonesia, or Burundi-but neither is it
exceptionally less violent.</li>
<li>The antidote to feel-good history is not feel-bad history but honest
and inclusive history. If textbook authors feel compelled to give moral
instruction, the way origin myths have always done, they could
accomplish this aim by allowing students to learn both the "good" and
the "bad" sides of the Pilgrim tale. Conflict would then become part of
the story, and students might discover that the knowledge they gain has
implications for their lives today. Correctly taught, the issues of the
era of the first Thanksgiving could help Americans grow more thoughtful
and more tolerant, rather than more ethnocentric.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="report">Report</h2>
<p>Before reading this paragraph, I learned a lot about the history of
North American Indians. So when I saw the title, I did not have too high
expectations in my heart. In addition, before reading this article, I
also watched a TED Talk shared by the teacher. That TED Talk mainly
tells the history of the Lakota ethnic group being deceived, oppressed,
and slaughtered by the white race for hundreds of years, which has
deeply aroused people's empathy. I thought this document would be like
the TED Talk, telling some of the contradictions between Indians and
White and then detailing the cruelty, hypocrisy, and cunning of White to
awaken national consciousness.</p>
<p>However, reading through the whole text, I can't help but admire the
author's original intention in writing. We can summarize his original
intention in the following three sentences.</p>
<div class="note success modern"><p>In history, truth should be held sacred at whatever cost.</p>
<p>U.S. history is no more violent and oppressive than the history of
England, Russia, Indonesia, or Burundi-but neither is it exceptionally
less violent.</p>
<p>What has happened cannot be changed, but today we work toward a
better America, a more Indian America where people and nature once again
are essential.</p>
</div>
<p>Through many details, the author explains why white immigrants
settled in the Americas, not colonized them. Then discuss the impact of
the plague on the Indians far beyond imagination. It has since been
explained that even for the Puritans aboard the Mayflower, their arrival
in the New World was hypocritical and by no means as noble as the
American history books record. It explains why Americans, and even major
Western countries, do their best to cover up this history of violence
and conflict to make their national claims look very noble. Written
here, the author has achieved the meaning of disenchanting American
history, but the author finally discusses his claim.</p>
<p>He wrote that much dirt is behind the seemingly glorious history of
the United States. However, discussing these issues is not to criticize
the United States but to enable Americans, especially American children,
to recognize and face up to the history of their own country. America's
history is full of violence and conflict, but this is a common human
problem, not an American problem. The United States will not be more
conflicted than Russia, China, and India, but it will never be less.
Everything he writes is about making a better America.</p>
<p>Next, I would like to discuss two aspects in detail.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-irresponsible-to-question-the-impact-of-the-disease.">It
is irresponsible to question the impact of the disease.</h3>
<p>Some scholars believe that because the Black Death only killed
one-third of the people in Eurasia, they questioned that milder diseases
such as smallpox and malaria would not kill more than 90% of the
Indians. The author criticizes this and believes that these so-called
scholars are just unwilling to admit the hypocrisy of the history
written in textbooks, want to maintain the sanctity of American history,
and insist on the tone of the past.</p>
<p>But pre-Pilgrim American epidemiology is not a field of everyday
knowledge in which "common sense" can be allowed to substitute for years
of relevant research. By "common sense," what these scholars meant was
tradition. The author spends considerable time in the original text
discussing why the disease has a tremendous impact. Many diseases sound
very mild in Eurasia. Why did the Indians die in large numbers? I was
also surprised by this, and I was skeptical at first. Also, I've read
something similar in Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human
Societies, and I still find it a little unbelievable. However, after
reading the author's exposition or studying the historical materials
written by the author, my doubts have been resolved.</p>
<p>Deviating from some so-called common sense and thinking through
learning has always benefited me a lot. However, many people do not want
to do so. Because for humans, thinking based on logic is pain or a
burden. The goal of learning and logical thinking is to seek a new body
of knowledge, which must first overthrow the inherent mode of thinking.
For example, after learning Newton's laws, you deny the common sense
that large and small iron balls fall at different speeds, and you must
abandon the intuition that force is the cause of object motion. This
process is very uncomfortable and can even cause a sense of strangeness
and fear in the world because of reacquainting with the environment.</p>
<p>Therefore, human instinct is to protect the spiritual comfort zone
and refuse to give up existing knowledge systems. If it is not for the
great benefit or fear of threats, human beings would instead tie up and
burn those who force themselves to think and accept the simple and crude
answers provided by religion. In the 10,000-year history of civilized
society, most human beings usually allowed a particular religion to
exercise spiritual control over themselves. The main reason is to obtain
an answer and gain a sense of psychological security.</p>
<p>However, in the past few hundred years, the tremendous geographical
discovery and the industrial revolution have brought unprecedented
development space for humankind, and the situation has begun to change.
Some people find that they can lead a more prosperous and accessible
life through logical and rational thinking. Some people even find that
if they do not learn to think logically and solve problems with reason,
the spiritual security provided by religion and feudalism cannot be
maintained. Therefore, the modern education system has expanded
worldwide along with the industrial society, forming the modern society
we are familiar with.</p>
<p>Above is my understanding of the necessity of learning and thinking
logically. The same goes for this article. Only when we give up the
so-called common sense about diseases and learn relevant historical
materials can we realize the massive impact of conditions on Indians and
then face up to the history of whites and Indians. Emotions cannot
resolve conflicts, and conflicts are not ethnic conflicts.</p>
<p>Throughout the article, the author does not have much emotional
narrative, which is different from the TED Talk I mentioned at the
beginning. And I agree more with the author's approach. Emotions cannot
solve contradictions. Only by facing history squarely can we solve
contradictions.</p>
<h3
id="emotions-cannot-resolve-conflicts-and-conflicts-are-not-ethnic-conflicts.">Emotions
cannot resolve conflicts, and conflicts are not ethnic conflicts.</h3>
<p>However, the author has written so much that I do not see how he
views the contradiction between the Indians and the white colonists. One
of the big reasons I cannot entirely agree with the TED Talk is that TED
Talk constantly exaggerates the conflicts between nationalities,
believing that the root of the conflict is that two different
nationalities have lived in a very long historical process with massive
oppression and bleeding. There are many bloodsheds, and the current
white people need to atone for the sins of their ancestors.</p>
<p>This view has some validity, but I cannot fully agree with it because
the source of conflict is not a race. I believe in Marxism, and for me,
there is only one kind of contradiction in the world: the contradiction
between the vested interests and the proletariat.</p>
<p>Marx creatively put forward the theory of class struggle in the 19th
century, arguing that all social history so far is the history of class
struggle. The difference between the vested interests and the
proletariat is whether or not the means of production are mastered.
Those who master the means of production are the bourgeoisie, and those
who do not master the means of production are the proletariat. Marxist
theory is so simple that even an uneducated person can know which class
he belongs to and who his enemy is.</p>
<p>To disrupt the impact of the proletariat on their rule, vested
interests in the United States created the theory of identity
politics.</p>
<p>The main feature of the so-called identity politics is the political
movement based on identity. In detail, the American ruling class
differentiates between groups with different external characteristics.
For example, people are divided into black, gay, Asian, transgender, and
so on. All the demands of the proletariat are anti-oppression. However,
the ruling class does not speak of anti-oppression, only labels. For
example, today, the ruling class designs policies to care for black
people. Then other groups will be dissatisfied and start to hate black
people. Then, the ruling class develops an approach to taking care of
homosexuals. The homosexuals are satisfied, and other groups are
dissatisfied. By analogy, these policies are similar, but the ruling
class has to formulate them separately and distribute benefits according
to various labels. Finally, the contradiction between the ruling class
and the proletariat is transformed into a conflict between labels. This
is the so-called identity politics.</p>
<p>In the Marxist view, the only enemy of the American proletariat is
the ruling class itself. However, through identity politics, the
proletariat has become enemies of each other because of their different
identities, and the real enemy is hidden behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Only a party based on a precise class can formulate an effective
movement program. For example, the working class will hope to form a
Labour Party and establish a sound social welfare system. To ensure the
quality of people's work and life, the bourgeoisie will want to develop
a liberal party, reduce the market regulation, and facilitate them to
squeeze the labor income of the proletariat. However, it is difficult
for political parties established by external identities to have precise
demands. Suppose a black party was set; what else could they do but
demand better welfare for all blacks? When underclass blacks label
themselves black Americans, their enemies change from vested interests
to groups of other colors. Yet the vast majority of other groups are
also proletarians. This will only lead to infighting the proletariat
rather than genuinely resisting the oppression of those with vested
interests.</p>
<p>Only when every proletarian American realizes that he is an American,
not a so-called African-American or Asian-American and that his enemies
are vested interests of the United States and not other fellow Americans
can unite and make a nation better instead of putting your group at odds
with other groups.</p>
<h1 id="the.black-atlantic">The.Black Atlantic</h1>
<p>Overall, I have a high opinion of the film. The film's exploration of
the sense of national origin and freedom is excellent. Although it
deeply touched my sensibilities, I felt that the film's discussion of
resistance to the oppression of slavery was not spot on and even worthy
of criticism. I am afraid I have to disagree with the film's dialogue
about the Haitian revolution, which is highly regarded.</p>
<div class="note primary modern"><p>Haiti, the world's first black republic.</p>
<p>Never before in history have enslaved people overthrown their
masters.</p>
</div>
<p>The history of the Haitian Revolution is briefly summarized in the
film as the overthrow of the French colonists by enslaved Black people,
the unification of a black republic, and the establishment of equality
as the basis of the state. By this logic, it would seem that Haiti has a
great history and is still a country with a bright future. However, the
truth is the exact opposite.</p>
<p>On February 22, 2021, the UN Security Council met on the issue of
Haiti. China's Deputy Representative to the UN, Ambassador Geng Shuang,
severely criticized the Republic of Haiti. He pointed out that the
Haitian people do not seem to see their future and that the Haitian
government and leaders bear the primary responsibility for the current
situation of disappointment and despair. The country's governance has
been highly unsuccessful for a long time, with endless battles, inactive
politicians, and repeated abuses of power and corruption.</p>
<p>Generally, the Chinese government rarely openly criticizes the
internal affairs of foreign countries. Yet, Haiti is a country that
recognizes the divisive regime in Taipei and has a low level of national
development. One hundred eighty-nine countries participated in the UN
Human Development Index ranking in 2019. Haiti ranked 169th,
surprisingly followed by war-torn Afghanistan, which has been at war for
years.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Haiti is a garbage dump inhabited by millions
of people. Less than half a million people have access to the fruits of
modern civilization. No one would threaten me with hell if I were a
Haitian civilian. Haiti is not in Africa and has not had a foreign war
for decades, yet the country is ridiculously backward.</p>
<p>There are several layers to Haiti's backwardness that I believe are
responsible.</p>
<p>First, most people understand Haiti's severe economic burden after
independence. When enslavers ruled it, the Haitian government grew very
little food on the island to highlight the economic benefits of
plantations. It mainly grew cash crops in exchange for food. In
addition, the extreme oppression of the enslavers led to most blacks
becoming expendable. The average life expectancy of 21 years made it
difficult for them to live their whole life. After independence,
however, blacks wanted to spend their entire lives on the island,
leading to a severe ration crisis. The conversion of coffee and cotton
plantations to rations made cash crops less internationally competitive
than during the colonial era. In addition, after independence, the
Haitian Negroes drove out the French land forces, but no navy existed.
It was still necessary to be recognized by the European and American
powers to sell their products. However, Europe was less willing to
recognize Haiti as a country with independent trade needs. Haiti had to
give France 60 million francs in reparations, putting a heavy burden on
the economy.</p>
<p>However, Haiti was once one of the most economically valuable islands
in the world. Tobacco, sugar cane, cotton, and coffee were all of
outstanding quality in quantity. On the eve of independence, the island
supplied France with two-thirds of its imports and exports in the late
18th century. France was also a global colonial empire. On this basis,
after independence, even with the colonial era's economic burdens, Haiti
should improve for two centuries.</p>
<p>There must be a deeper reason for this. Most people believe that it
is also because Haiti has not had any leaders with long-term goals for a
long time. Most rulers were greedy dictators who trusted nothing but
violence. In 1805, just after Haiti's independence, Dessalines, who had
inherited Toussaint's military legacy, crowned himself emperor and
established Haiti's first empire. But only a year later, he was
assassinated. After him, whichever dictator came to power, to satisfy
his desire for enjoyment and to raise money for the military, he was
keen to restore the plantation slavery of the colonial era, and the
oppression of ordinary blacks was even more brutal than that of the
European colonizers.</p>
<p>In recent times, President Hayti changed once every year or two, and
only in recent years did he barely achieve a few peaceful handovers. But
no president has been able to make sweeping changes to Haitian society.
For decades, the only thing each Haitian president has focused on is
asking for a little foreign aid. And yet, state governance throughout
Haiti remains very poor. In his criticism of Haiti, Ambassador Geng
Shuang pointed out that the United Nations has invested at least $8
billion in aid over the last 30 years to help Haiti emerge from the
crisis, but it has not worked.</p>
<p>Historically, Haiti's dozens of brutal and incompetent rulers are the
direct cause of Haiti's backwardness, but that explanation still doesn't
convince me. After all, Haiti has been almost 100 regime changes in over
200 years, and the odds are that these presidents and warlords cannot
all be inherently cruel and incompetent contrarians. By comparison,
Dominica, to the east of Haiti, also went through a period of successive
warlord rule but now has a per capita economy ten times that of Haiti.
To explain Haiti's backwardness entirely in terms of the personal
qualities of the dictator is still, in effect, to attribute the problem
to nebulous luck or ethnic identity. As a materialist, I cannot accept
such an answer.</p>
<p>I think the real problem in Haiti is that the revolution was too
violent and changed the social system too quickly.</p>
<p>For the revolutionaries, revolting against the colonizers was their
only reason for solidarity, and destroying the old system was their only
common agenda. Once the colonizers left, and the officers found
themselves with complete freedom of action, they did not even know how
to deprive steadily as the old rulers had done but would only treat the
population as a one-time object of extraction and impose a more brutal
and murderous rule.</p>
<p>Haiti inherited only a tiny material heritage and military
organization left by the colonizers but wholly abandoned all the
historical experience of social organization and started entirely from
scratch to create a civilized society while competing economically and
militarily with other countries. So within two hundred years, the
spectacle and violence of thousands of other countries were repeated,
and finally, even the material base was depleted.</p>
<p>Before independence, Haiti was a plantation colony. But to maintain a
prosperous colony, it was not enough to have colonists and enslaved
Black people but also to have a middle class responsible for managing
repression and commercial operations. 89% of Haiti's population was
black in 1789. However, in addition to colonial officials and the
original plantation owners, tens of thousands of lower-class whites and
mestizos ran commerce, organized daily supplies, and provided technical
services.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Haitian Revolution, the boundaries between classes
and races on the island were apparent, and the confrontation of
interests was sharper than in France itself. After the Haitian
Revolution, each class suffered heavy losses. After the War of
Independence, the 500,000 enslaved Black people were reduced by half,
while 40,000 whites were left with only 10,000 of mixed race. 1801 saw
Toussaint tricked and killed by the French, leading to violent class and
racial retaliation by his successors. By the time the War of
Independence was over, the middle class had disappeared mainly, and
blacks had lost the agency to inherit the ability to rule in modern
Europe. After the French killed Toussaint, subsequent rulers were left
to figure out their ruling experience from scratch, as the early chiefs
had done thousands of years earlier. Unable to make real compromises or
propose progressive ideologies, they often ran into walls left and right
and finally worshipped violence nakedly to rebel against the previous
rulers and sweep away their political system. For the foreseeable
future, Haitian is still a desperate country where human society
advances in the middle of constant do-nothing.</p>
<p>Throughout human history, each new era is born only through the
destruction of the previous one. But this law is often reduced to a
misconception that the overthrow of the old system must be progressing,
and some people will even directly turn the entire system of the old
society upside down and say that this is a new era. Based on a similar
logic, Haiti's first emperor, Defalin, purged the white and mestizo
classes and dragged Haiti into more than a century of turmoil.</p>
<p>The root cause of Haiti's backwardness as a country was the overly
homogeneous composition of society in the early years of independence,
the conflicting goals of the classes capable of exploring a new era, and
the enslaved Black people who made up the bulk of the population. Very
few sensible leaders could only maintain the balance between the two
social groups. But after the French cheated President Toussaint, the
trust between the social groups was destroyed by the war, and the
society lost its basis of unity. The ability to organize most civilized
societies was lost, and it had to regress to the early days of
civilization. Even to this day, Haiti is still a failed state.</p>
<p>Telling so much about the reasons for the failure of modern Haiti
does not seem to be the same as the original purpose of our course.
However, as a materialist, I believe that the core of our course is to
be aware of the many ethnic problems in the United States at this stage.
However, a clear understanding is insufficient to suggest appropriate
ways to change the current situation. For example, just because whites
have oppressed blacks for a long time, we cannot just assume that blacks
are all inferior and miserable or even demand that all whites repay
their ancestors for their exploitation of blacks.</p>
<p>I believe that the complexity of the ethnic issue itself goes far
beyond what can be discussed in our course. Even when it comes to a
specific ethnic group, such as the Indian issue that we discussed
earlier, there is severe exploitation and oppression within the same
Indian tribe and between different tribes, as evidenced by the Indian
chiefs who oppressed others in Wounded Knee. We cannot simply assume
that white people must oppress the Indians and that the Indians must be
the oppressed who suffer. Returning to the black issue, we cannot
believe that the solution to oppression is anti-oppression and that the
answer to the massacre is a reverse massacre. We can see from the
history of the development of Haiti as a country rebelling against the
colonizers and destroying the old system is not the solution to
oppression. How solve the problem of vulnerable minorities requires very
much more inquiry.</p>
<!--# **1862 年就得到解放，为什么美国黑人至今无法呼吸**-->
<!--整部影片的探讨非常深入，是目前为止课程所播放的影片里我认为讨论的最为精彩的。影片的观点大致阐述了即便废除了奴隶制，美国社会仍然对黑人有着系统性的歧视，甚至国家利用第十三条宪法修正案迫使从黑奴身份中得到解放的黑人再次沦为了奴隶，不过这次是国家的奴隶，是资本家的机器。-->
<!--我想在影片的基础上谈谈我对这个现状的其他理解。-->
<!--单纯废奴是不负责任的-->
<!--如果没有深入接触过相关的史料，大多人会认为南北战争之后，废除了奴隶制的黑人得到了可贵的自由，生活质量得以显著提升。然而，南北战争前后，都有南方人指责林肯，认为黑人获得自由以后过得并不好，生活水平有所下降。这是事实，毕竟当时美国工业水平还很低，底层工人的日子就是那么艰难，对于新增加的黑人劳动力更不友好。结果就是，和大多数人的想象不同，黑人在南方的劳动强度比北方小，死亡率相对比较低。南方黑奴在农忙时，还有烟草嚼，有甘蔗酒喝，而北方自由黑人进入工厂就和欧洲工人阶级一样，没几年就会被剥削到死。-->
<!--美国文学巨著《飘》对于奴隶制的态度就很温和，书中认为北方光废奴不负责，还导致了社会犯罪率激增。这本书描绘的南方家庭常年养黑奴，部分黑奴在家里面地位还不低，被压迫程度并不强。-->
<!--当然，我不会为奴隶制而辩护，因为我拒绝在两个魔鬼之间做选择。在资本家眼里黑人是工具，在奴隶主眼里黑人是财产。前者活得不像人，后者本身就不被当成人好好对待。-->
<!--南北战争结束以后，非洲裔美国人得到解放，而这个解放仅仅是从商品回到了被压迫的无产阶级。1868 年黑人获得公民权，1870 年获得男性投票权。然而，林肯被刺杀以后，南方人安德鲁约翰逊接任总统，对于南方各州的白人至上主义者放任不管，大搞种族隔离政策，这些法律统称为吉姆克劳法。-->
<!--接下来 100 年的种族隔离，造成黑人在经济，教育和社会意识上永远输的起跑线。到了今天，但很多人不看过程，只看结果，所以每当说到黑人的时候，总有种族主义者喜欢炒作，批评黑人自己不努力，不怪别人，有黑人地方就有犯罪，他们不读书，不好好做事。-->
<!--然而，可想而知，这绝不是黑人自身的民族问题。让每个都能够自由平等地在人世间生活，还有很长的路要走。-->
<!--为什么警察系统的种族歧视问题一直得不到解决？-->
<!--我印象非常深刻的一件事情是，2020 年发生黑命贵运动后，很多美国保守外媒体都在替美国警察辩护，甚至很多中国自媒体也纷纷发言说黑人虽然只占美国百分之十三的人口，但是犯罪率高，制造了百分之五十二的犯罪事件，所以活该被暴力执法。但是如果美国警察真的按照保守派媒体的逻辑工作，开枪率就应该和暴力犯罪率直接相关。-->
<!--然而，但是统计数据表明，美国警察的杀人率和暴力犯罪率基本没关系，主要影响因素是有没有接受约束暴力的抗议。此外，正如影片中提到的那样，美国做过前瞻性研究。对警察的测试结果证明，在面对黑人目标的时候，警察更倾向于开枪，反应时间也更短。更严重的是，被捕以后，司法部门对黑人的判刑往往更重。-->
<!--为什么警察系统的种族歧视问题一直得不到解决？我个人认为，美国警察为所欲为是因为警察工会营造的利益集团实在太大，绑架了美国政治。-->
<!--美国警察组织宣布自己是社会的支柱，在自身体系内有几套依托熟人社会的工会体系维护着他们的利益。这些警察工会不仅给会员家庭提供各种社会服务，而且还都到国会游说讨要支出预算。但是警察系统不缺钱，按照美国司法统计局的统计，2015 年美国的司法总支出 2261 亿美元。差不多是这一年中国军费两倍。此外，司法统计局忽略了维持治安的警察系统的预算。有人估计过美国每年警察和监狱上消耗的资金大概是 5000 亿美元，快赶上美国军费了。很多警察在没有什么危险的地方去巡逻，就能领 20 多万美元的工资。他们随便拿出一点收入来支持工会，工会就能凑很多钱去影响政策的制定。换言之，警察工会系统就是个典型的封建团体。而每次暴力执法引发社会骚乱后，政府都会尝试推动警察改革，但是迫于工会的阻力，最后只是把涉事的警察免职。甚至，有的警察被开除以后，公会还能想办法再让他进入警察系统内的其他部门。从这些例子看，警察是美国最顽固的利益集团之一，和码头工人，医生差不多。-->
<!--此外，美国是一个持枪率很高的国家，警察日常工作应该会比中国危险，那这能不能解释他们的一部分特权呢？如果说持枪率高导致了危险，美国警察应该反对普遍持枪才对。但是大多数美国警察是特朗普的粉丝，从来不觉得枪支泛滥是问题。之前美国对警察做过权威调查，问如果禁止民间持有十发以上子弹的弹夹，会不会减少犯罪。然而，百分之九十五的警察都认为，弹夹和犯罪没有关系，还有百分之九十的警察认为，如果有持枪公民在枪击案现场，反而会减少伤枪击案的伤亡。所以说美国警察是一个封建利益团体，甚至已经和军阀类似。美国民间持枪，真正的受害者只能是平民。-->
<!--美国虽然枪击案很多，但跨种族的枪击案很少。基本上是黑人杀黑人，白人杀白人，死于枪支的白人大多数是自杀。但是死于子弹的黑人基本上是他杀，所以黑人最支持进枪。从这个对比看，与其说美国法律允许持枪，是鼓励公民反抗政府，不如说是为了给警察提供滥用暴力的理由，顺便也掩盖了警察系统的种族歧视问题。-->
<h1
id="emancipated-in-1862-why-are-black-americans-still-unable-to-breathe">Emancipated
in 1862, why are black Americans still unable to breathe?</h1>
<p>The entire film is very in-depth and is, in my opinion, the best
discussion of any of the films shown in the course. The point of view of
the film is generally that even after the abolition of slavery, American
society continued to systematically discriminate against blacks, even as
the state used the Thirteenth Amendment to force blacks freed from black
slavery into slavery again, but this time as slaves of the state, as
capitalist machines. I want to build on the film to discuss my other
understandings of this status quo. Abolition alone is irresponsible.
Without in-depth exposure to the relevant historical sources, most
people would assume that after the Civil War, abolitionist blacks were
given valuable freedom and were able to improve their quality of life
significantly. However, before and after the Civil War, some Southerners
blamed Lincoln for the fact that blacks were not doing well after being
freed and that their standard of living had declined. This was true,
after all, the industrial level of America was still deficient at that
time, and the bottom workers had such a hard time that it was even more
unfriendly to the newly added black labor force.</p>
<p>Contrary to what most people think, black labor was less intense in
the South than in the North, and the death rate was relatively low.
While Southern Negroes still had tobacco to chew and sugar cane wine to
drink during the farming season, free Northern Negroes entered the
factories just like the European working class and would be exploited to
death within a few years.</p>
<p>The American literary masterpiece "Gone with the Wind" is very mild
about slavery. The book argues that the North was not responsible for
the abolition of enslaved people alone, but it also led to a surge in
social crime. The book portrays Southern families who kept black slaves
year-round, some of whom were not low-status inside their homes and were
not oppressed to any great extent.</p>
<p>Of course, I will not defend slavery because I refuse to choose
between two devils. In the eyes of capitalists, blacks are tools. In the
eyes of enslavers, blacks are property. The former lived like no human
being, and the latter were not appropriately treated as human beings
themselves.</p>
<p>After the Civil War, African-Americans were emancipated, and this
emancipation was only from the commodity back to the oppressed
proletariat. 1868 saw the enfranchisement of blacks, and 1870 saw the
right to vote for men. However, after Lincoln's assassination, Andrew
Johnson, a Southerner, took over as president and let the white
supremacists in the Southern states off the hook with a segregation
policy, collectively known as the Jim Crow laws. The following 100 years
of segregation forever caused blacks to lose the starting line in
economic, educational, and social consciousness.</p>
<p>To this day, many people don't look at the process, only the results,
so whenever it comes to blacks, there are always racists who like to
excite and criticize blacks for not trying themselves and not blaming
others, that where there are blacks, there is a crime, they don't study
and don't do their jobs properly. However, it is conceivable that this
is never an ethnic problem for blacks. There is still a long way to go
for each to live freely and equally in the human world.</p>
<h2
id="why-has-the-problem-of-racial-discrimination-in-the-police-system-not-been-solved">Why
has the problem of racial discrimination in the police system not been
solved?</h2>
<p>One thing that struck me was that after the Black Lives Matter
movement happened in 2020, many American conservative foreign media were
defending American police. Even many Chinese self-publishers were
speaking out, saying that black people. However, they only makeup
thirteen percent of the U.S. population, have a high crime rate and
create fifty-two percent of all crimes, so they deserve to be violently
enforced. But if American police worked according to the logic of the
conservative media, the shooting rate would be directly correlated with
the violent crime rate.</p>
<p>However, statistics show that the homicide rate of American police
and the violent crime rate is mainly unrelated. The main influencing
factor is whether or not protests of restrained violence are accepted.
Moreover, as mentioned in the film, prospective studies have been done
in the United States. Tests on police officers have proven that when
confronted with black targets, officers are more inclined to shoot and
have shorter reaction times. More seriously, the judiciary tends to
impose heavier sentences on blacks after arrest.</p>
<p>Why does the problem of racial discrimination in the police system
remain unresolved? I believe that American police officers do whatever
they want because the interest groups created by police unions are too
big and have kidnapped American politics.</p>
<p>American police organizations declare themselves to be the pillars of
society and have several union systems within their system that rely on
acquaintance society to defend their interests. These police unions not
only provide various social services to their members' families but also
go to Congress to lobby for spending budgets. But there is no shortage
of money in the police system. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice
Statistics, total judicial spending in the United States in 2015 was
226.1 billion dollars. That's nearly twice as much as China's military
spending that year. In addition, the Bureau of Justice Statistics
ignores the budget for the police system, which maintains law and order.
Some have estimated that the U.S. spends about 500 billion dollars
yearly on police and prisons, almost as much as the U.S. military. Many
police officers are paid more than 200,000 dollars to patrol places with
little danger. If they give a little of their income to support the
unions, the unions can put together a lot of money to influence policy.
In other words, the police union system is a classic feudalist group.
Whenever violent law enforcement causes social unrest, the government
tries to push for police reform. Still, due to union resistance, it only
ends up removing the officers involved from their jobs. Even after some
police officers were fired, the guild could find a way to get him into
another department within the police system again. From these examples,
the police are one of the most stubborn interest groups in the United
States, much like the dockers and doctors.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. has a high gun ownership rate, and police
should be more dangerous in their daily work than in China, so can this
explain part of their privileges? If the high gun ownership rate causes
danger, it is only suitable that American police should be against
universal gun ownership. But most American police officers are Trump
fans and never feel that the proliferation of guns is a problem. The
United States has previously done authoritative surveys of police
officers, asking whether the crime would be reduced if civilian
possession of magazines with more than ten rounds of ammunition were
banned. However, ninety-five percent of police officers agreed that
magazines had nothing to do with crime, and another ninety percent
believed that having armed citizens at the shooting scene would reduce
casualties from wounded shootings. So the American police is a feudal
interest group, even has been similar to the warlords. The real victims
of gun ownership by American citizens can only be civilians.</p>
<p>Although there are many shootings in the United States, there are
very few interracial shootings. Blacks kill blacks, whites kill whites,
and most whites who die from guns commit suicide. But blacks who die
from bullets are homicides, so blacks are most supportive of getting
into guns. From this comparison, rather than encouraging citizens to
rebel against the government, allowing guns under U.S. law is designed
to give police officers a reason to abuse violence and, incidentally, to
cover up the problem of racial discrimination in the police system.</p>
<h1 id="why-is-your-face-so-red">Why is Your Face so Red?</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, today I would like to answer a question asked by a
classmate.</p>
<p>On September 27th, I participated in a group discussion for the first
time in the course. One of the students in the group asked curiously:
Are you a little nervous? Why is your face so red?</p>
<p>Thanks to his concern, his question made me ponder. In fact, I have
been asked the same question by countless people.</p>
<p>Hi, Eren. Why is your face so red?</p>
<p>At the very beginning, I was embarrassed by this question.</p>
<p>As a newcomer to middle school, I had very low self-esteem. I was
always worried that giving the answer to the question would make my
classmates feel contempt for me. I just had to tell them I was more
nervous, so my face was redder.</p>
<p>However, this is not the case. I was born in a small city called
Barkam on the western plateau of Sichuan. The redness on my face is
plateau redness, which is my ancestors, my ethnicity, and my hometown,
engraved on my body throughout my life.</p>
<p>Barkam is 2200 meters above sea level, and the weather is cold all
year round. It is a small, simple city, so small that there are no
skyscrapers, no playgrounds, and only in 2011 did it get a movie
theater. However, many Tibetan, Qiang, Hui, and Han ethnic groups gather
in this small city, and I am a Qiang person.</p>
<p>Until I entered middle school, I was not ashamed of which ethnicity I
belonged to or where I came from. However, my family told me to mention
less about my hometown and never to say that I am a minority. I was
taken aback, and after school started, I seemed to understand some of
the reasons why.</p>
<p>When I was in elementary school, I did not study English, but I did
study Tibetan. And the Chinese I learned was not called Yuwen but
Guowen. My Chinese and English were abysmal when I first entered middle
school. Whenever I stumbled over my poor English, there seemed to be
countless eyes annotating me. They asked me, "Where are you from, and
why are you so bad at English?"</p>
<p>So much so that I felt susceptible about my hometown and identity
with my mouth shut. And when people asked me curiously, Why is your face
so red? I was always worried that it would reveal my identity and
ethnicity, so I was always vague.</p>
<p>In short, I was ashamed of my hometown and my ethnicity.</p>
<p>Things changed when I entered high school. There was a call for
travel articles about Northwest Sichuan in my campus magazine. I was
excited to write an essay about my hometown memories but then submit it
anonymously. I was always worried that my classmates would know where I
was from. Still, I was very excited but apprehensive about submitting my
article. Surprisingly, my article was well received. I even wanted to
proudly say that this article is written by myself, and it's about my
dearest hometown. However, I didn't, I still felt shy in my bones, yet I
had a powerful voice inside. I wanted to speak loudly about my hometown
and my ethnicity.</p>
<p>When I went to college, I was once again confronted with the
curiosity of my roommate. Where are you from, and why are you so red in
the face. This time, I plucked up my courage, I came from the western
Sichuan plateau, and the redness on my face was plateau redness.
Surprisingly, they were interested and happy to discuss their hometowns
with me. It turns out that everyone's hometown has a fascinating story,
and they are so different from each other. It turns out that everyone
has his own identity, though they may not necessarily be an ethnic
minority.</p>
<p>I felt that the shy corners of my heart were melted away and replaced
by gratitude and pride in my hometown.</p>
<p>Today, people still ask me, "Why is your face so red?"</p>
<p>This time, I no longer feel shy. I will happily say that this is the
plateau redness, the mark left imprinted on my body by my hometown.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the permanent mark that my hometown carved on the face
of her distant children. One day several years from now, when I am far
away from home, the redness of my face will also be the mark that proves
where I came from.</p>
<p><strong>I firmly believe that one day in the future, when I cross the
pacific ocean and attend an academic oral report on the other side of
our planet, some researchers will ask me this:</strong></p>
<p>Oh, my little research scientist, your research and oral report are
profound. But why are you feeling so nervous? We <strong>all see your
face went red throughout the presentation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I will be proud to say, Thanks for your appreciation.
However, sir, I am not nervous. I am a Chinese who feels proud of his
motherland and hometown, and the red blush on my cheeks is plateau
redness, which is the imprint of my dearest hometown on her distant
children.</strong> And I would be proud and grateful for it all my
life.</p>
